The photo was of a motor-cross competitor taking a tumble from his motorcycle. The date, 1955. The award, the first ever World Press Photo of the Year.
Almost every year since has seen a contest and a winning image. Some of the photos have become iconic — a naked girl running after a napalm attack in Vietnam; a Buddhist monk who has set himself alight; a sole demonstrator standing in front of tanks on Tiananmen Square. Others have set trends, established styles of press photography that can be seen re-emerging in years to come. 

Each of the images below are from the World Press Photo Foundation Archive and have been reimagined as Four Corners Images. We have used the Fourcorners template to add more contextual information to these historical frames but don't feel limited by such a literal application when you come to make your Four Corners images.

Greece sent 20,000 troops to the island, while Turkey responded to attacks on Turkish Cypriot areas with air strikes. In 1964 the United Nations sent in peacekeeping troops to support British soldiers manning the so-called \"Green Line\", set up to divide the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sectors of Nicosia.","author":"Don McCullin","magazine":"The Observer / Quick / Life","magazineUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1964/world-press-photo-year/don-mccullin","date":"20-03-1964"},"creativeCommons":{"copyright":"Don McCullin © 1964","codeOfEthics":"Entrants to the World Press Photo contest must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled.","description":"Ghaziveram, Cyprus.

Before the war, Lebanon was a multi-sectarian country, where Sunnis, Shias, Maronite Christians, Druze and several other communities lived together in a fragile co-existence. The establishment of the state of Israel, the displacement of hundred thousands of Palestinian refugees to Lebanon, the Cold War with its polarizing influence on Lebanese society, and the arrival in the early 1970s of armed forces of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) all had a disintegrative effect on the country. The civil war started with a series of retaliatory sectarian attacks but would eventually become a long and complicated conflict, which also involved countries from outside Lebanon, including Israel and Syria. When Françoise Demulder came to Amsterdam to receive her World Press Photo of the Year award in 1977, she told the Dutch newspaper Het Vrije Volk that she had gone into the Christian zone on the day the Phalange decided to ‘cleanse’ the neighborhood of Karantina. She explained, “The Christians went from house to house in the Palestinian neighborhood. They shot at everyone there. There were 350 civilians, who ran from their homes crying. Palestinians came out with white flags on their rifles. But the Phalangists kept shooting, not caring who they hit. I had never experienced such a fanatic hatred there before—horrible.” According to Demulder, only the young girl and her child in the background of the image survived the massacre.","author":"Françoise Demulder","magazine":"Commissioned by Gamma","magazineUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1977/world-press-photo-year/fran%C3%A7oise-demulder","date":"January 18, 1976"},"creativeCommons":{"copyright":"Françoise Demulder © 1976","codeOfEthics":"Entrants to the World Press Photo contest must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled.","description":"Beirut, Lebanon.

Starved and attacked with machetes, he had managed to survive, though he was unable to speak and could barely walk or swallow when this photo was made. The animosity between the Hutu and Tutsi population groups in Rwanda had been simmering for decades. In April 1994, Hutu President Juvénal Habyarimana’s death in a plane crash near the capital of Kigali sparked murderous attacks on the Tutsi minority and Hutu moderates. The situation deteriorated further when the mainly Tutsi rebels of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) started pushing south from their stronghold in northern Rwanda. A mass exodus of people trying to escape excessive violence was underway by July.","author":"James Natchwey","magazine":"Magnum Photos for Time","magazineUrl":"https://www.worldpressphoto.org/collection/photo/1995/world-press-photo-year/james-nachtwey","date":"June 1, 1994"},"creativeCommons":{"copyright":"James Nachtwey © 1994","codeOfEthics":"Entrants to the World Press Photo contest must ensure their pictures provide an accurate and fair representation of the scene they witnessed so the audience is not misled.","description":"A Hutu man at a Red Cross hospital in Nyanza, Rwanda.
