title: Introduction to Class 2 - Interpretation
description: >-
  Welcome to the second installment of Talking Pictures, a new kind of socially
  driven online course. This week we are finding out about interpretation in
  photography, and the role it plays in our decisions as photographers and
  consumers of media. Before the "live class" starts, you should read the
  preparation material and submit your first Four Corners image. You can then
  get peer feedback and join discussion about your submission before the live
  class starts later in the week.

# Class 2 - Interpretation

How do we as photographers tell the story of a subject that is missing? How might one tell the story of loss, of the deceased, the invisible?

How might these images constitute or inform a body of evidence?

How might they and we, be believed?

What role does trust have, and how do we as storytellers gain that trust and imbue our work with it?
