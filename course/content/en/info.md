### Welcome to the Connected Academy!
 
**“Talking Pictures”** is an open course in critical visual storytelling. It is designed, and run in association with the _World Press Photo Foundation_. It is made up of seven classes which run every other week, these are accessible online and participation is free. Between the classes are webinar reviews where industry experts discuss some of the themes that have emerged and review some of the work that people have submitted.

Talking Pictures is not a traditional academic or training course. It does not teach technical skills, nor have a rigid set of learning outcomes that participants must achieve in order to “pass”. There are no exams.
 
Talking Pictures is a connected conversation about photography in the 21st century, and the classes are where those conversations begin. The format and the platform are designed to enable both the teacher and the participant to be parts of a global conversation that is informed by an international range of perspectives and joined live, by the same photographic experts who feature in the content. Participants are also invited to create, to share and to feedback on each other’s photographic responses, through the same networks.
 
For each class we have staged a conversation between a **photographer**, a **subject** and **someone who represents the audience**. A subject expert also provides historical or thematic context. These conversations are designed to help us address five key questions, namely:
 
- What are you saying?
- Who are you saying it to?
- How are you saying it?
- Why should they believe you?
- And finally, what do you want them to do as a result?
 
These are not the only questions we hope will emerge and throughout the conversations traditional storytelling themes such as Evidence, Interpretation, Fiction, Fact, Narrative and Impact are also discussed.
 
> For submitting photographs we are using Fred Ritchin’s Four Corners idea. Four Corners is an authoring and context tool that enables the photographer to furnish an image with extra content. This content should provide more information about both the subject, and the photographer.
